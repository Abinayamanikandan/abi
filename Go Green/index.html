    <li> <span>Increase Value of Your Home</span>
        You could significantly boost the value of your home by just making it eco-friendly. By installing solar panels on the rooftop or adding a water-saving toilet and shower, you will not only save money but create a perk for new buyers should you ever sell your home.
        
        Moreover, green homes use sustainable materials that have a low impact on the environment. Several governments also offer subsidies to individuals who go by the sustainable path. In the US, for instance, you are likely to receive attractive rebates on your energy bills, should you choose to install solar energy panels in your homes.</li>
    <li> <span> Savings in Energy Costs</span>
        The U.S Department of Energy states that if buildings were all green, the U.S. would use $20 billion less energy every single year. You can also receive discounts by making your home a greener one.
        
        These energy savings can come up as part of fixing small things in your home or office that can reduce your energy consumption. For e.g.: just by running your washing machine full loads, you can reduce a significant amount of water and power during each cycle.</li>
    <li> <span> money on your water bill</span>
        You can potentially save hundreds of dollars on your current water bill by merely choosing to be sustainable. Purchasing Energy Star appliances, as well as water-saving plumbing systems, will consistently save you hundreds of dollars on your water bill on an annual basis.</li>
    <li> <span> Homes are More Durable</span>
        When you create an eco-friendly home, you are creating a more durable home. Recycled products have the tendency to last over five times longer than traditional materials. This also means that you will save more money when it comes to maintaining your home.</li>
    <li><span>Improves Your Health</span>
        By purchasing an eco-friendly vehicle and home, you can decrease the number of pollutants that are emitted into the air. This makes both the indoors and outdoors have cleaner air for you and others to breathe.
        
        Ultimately, you will be breathing better air. Improved health means less spending on insurance products and hospital bills, which in turn will also save your costs in the long run.

    <li> <span>Air Quality</span>
        Using all-natural products makes you a healthier person. When you are healthy, you are also naturally more productive in the workplace.
        
        Note that the fewer chemicals the products you use, the fewer toxins you and your family are breathing in. Everything from household products to cosmetic products can be purchased as an eco-friendly variant.</li>
